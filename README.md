# Foundation Fury Pack

Welcome to the Foundation Fury Pack â€” a symbolic, humorous, and practical command-line utility set for those who walk the path of Unix/Linux with memory, grit, and style.

This project is dedicated to those who remember the flavor of real shells, and those who will write the next scripts in their own way.
