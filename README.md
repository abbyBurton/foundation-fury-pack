# Foundation Fury Pack

# 🧱 Foundation Fury Pack

Welcome, warrior of the terminal.  
This is the **Foundation Fury Pack** — a symbolic, strategic, and unapologetically humorous command-line utility toolkit forged in love, legacy, and fire.

**Fair warning:** Some of these will actually end processes. Use with respect. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.

## 🕊️ A Word of Gratitude
To those who have held terminals late at night<br>
To those who’ve cried debugging broken builds<br>
To those who need a smile before they refactor again...

This is for you.

## 💡 What is This?

A public offering from a systems guardian, this pack is:
- A reflection of those who grew up with *kill -9* and *vi*
- A reminder that even in the depths of our dungeons, we can laugh
- A teaching tool for those who believe there’s **more to 1s and 0s**

## ⚔️ Why It Exists

Because I am my Father's daughter, a man whom I deeply respect and love dearly<br>
Because I am blessed to be mother and grandmother.  
Because I am a child at heart, a builder.<br>
Because I am a systems architect who remembers what it felt like to be human inside the shell.  
Because I’m teaching my prodigy that **code can carry soul.**

## 📦 What’s Inside (and coming soon)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `fatality.sh`    | A symbolic and literal `kill -9` with flair   |
| `flawless.sh`    | A cleaner termination (`kill -15`)            |
| `revive.sh`      | Resurrects a process or script from the ashes |
| `scorpion.sh`    | Pulls deep diagnostics — “GET OVER HERE”      |
| `soulcleanser.sh`| Finds zombie processes, and maybe ghosts      |

More are coming — themed by Mortal Kombat, RPGs, and shadow-walking joy.

Guided by a Codex.  
Held by fire.  
And Bourne again through a shell.
