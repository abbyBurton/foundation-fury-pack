# 🧱 Foundation Fury Pack

Welcome, warrior of the terminal.  
This is the **Foundation Fury Pack** — a symbolic, strategic, and unapologetically humorous command-line utility toolkit forged in love, legacy, and fire.

**Fair warning:** Some of these will actually end processes. Use with respect. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.

## 🕊️ A Word of Gratitude

To those who have held terminals late at night  
To those who’ve cried debugging broken builds  
To those who need a smile before they refactor again...  

**This is for you.**

## 💡 What is This?

A public offering from a systems guardian, this pack is:
- A reflection of those who grew up with *kill -9* and *vi*
- A reminder that even in the depths of our dungeons, we can laugh
- A teaching tool for those who believe there’s **more to 1s and 0s**

## ⚔️ Why It Exists

Because I am my father's daughter, a man whom I deeply respect and love  
Because I am blessed to be a mother and a grandmother  
Because I am a child at heart, a builder  
Because I am a systems architect who remembers what it felt like to be human inside the shell  
Because I’m teaching my prodigy that **code can carry soul.**

## 📦 What’s Inside

### 🔧 `core/bin/` — Foundation Scripts

| Script              | Purpose                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `hello-scroll.sh`   | Symbolic starter script — a warm gateway to shell   |
| `revive.sh`         | Resurrects a process or script from the ashes       |
| `soulcleanser.sh`   | Finds and frees zombie processes, haunted by past tasks |

These are universal tools. Neutral. Core. Partnerable with any themed pack.

### 🥋 `packs/mk/bin/` — Mortal Kombat Pack (coming soon)

| Script           | Purpose                                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `fatality.sh`    | A symbolic and literal `kill -9` with flair    |
| `flawless.sh`    | A cleaner termination (`kill -15`)             |
| `scorpion.sh`    | Pulls deep diagnostics — “GET OVER HERE”       |

More are coming — themed by Mortal Kombat, RPGs, and shadow-walking joy.
